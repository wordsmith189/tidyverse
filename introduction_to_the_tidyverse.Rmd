# Working with R == objects + functions

---

class: middle

**objects** - things that can be stored in variables, our data, the thing we are interested in

**functions** - the tools we apply to our objects in order to find things out about them 

---

## Some of the functions we already know

```{r eval=F}
sum()
class()
c()
as.numeric()
paste()
colnames()
rownames()
```

---
## How functions function

```{r eval=F}
functionname(arg1, arg2, arg3, ...)
```

*Technically*, arguments are optional.

*Typically*, there is at minimum an arg1, and it is the main one: it is the "object" of the action performed by the function.

# Physically, what is the tidyverse?

- A meta-package that is meant to be loaded at the beginning of a work session. 
- It actually loads a long list of dependency packages under the hood. 
- Together, they change the state and some basic aspects of working with R.

## Let's load the tidyverse

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# What changes when you load tidyverse?

---

# (1) Pipes

package: `magrittr`

![pipe](https://www.museumtv.art/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ceci-nest-pas-une-pipe1-e1502441198132.jpg)

The package name is a pun on *pipe*. (Actual title: La trahison des images; painted 1929)


---

## *Pipes* are a way of programming.



Compare 
```{r eval=F}
order(fruitData$Juice, decreasing=TRUE)
```



to
```{r eval = F}
fruitData$Juice %>% order(decreasing=TRUE)
```

Both commands do exactly the same thing. 

---

## In the abstract:

.pull-left[
base-R:

```{r eval = F}
functionname(arg1, arg2, ...)
```
]

.pull-right[
tidyverse-R:

```{r eval = F}
arg1 %>% 
  functionname(arg2, ...)
```
]

---

## Advantage of coding with pipes

Code is much more legible than in base-R, e.g.

```{r eval=F}
df %>% 
  select(1:6) %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  unique()
```

and not
```{r eval = F}
unique(na.omit(df[1:6,]))
```


Can be more easily ported,  applied to different objects.

---

# (2) Verbs, adverbs, nouns...

objects: **'nouns'**

main functions: **'verbs'**

wrapper functions that help run other functions (verbs) in a certain way: **'adverbs'**

---

## Verbs at the heart of tidyverse

The following verbs are all from the arch-package `dplyr`, which forms the center of the tidyverse.


`select()`


`filter()`


`summarise()`


`count()`


`arrange()`

---

# (3) The 'tidy' aspect

## Tidy data

```{r xaringan-tachyons, echo=FALSE}
xaringanExtra::use_tachyons()
```
.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualise, and have a special structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table.

## An untidy dataset

```{r echo=FALSE}
cars <- c("audi a4", "golf gti", "new beetle", "audi a8")
buyers_gender <- c("male")
gender_percent <- c(50, 80, 40, 60)
avg_hp <- c(120, 140, 90, 190)
dat <- data.frame(cars, buyers_gender, gender_percent, avg_hp)
dat %>% knitr::kable()
```

---

## A tidy dataset

```{r echo=FALSE}
cars <- c("a4", "a8", "a8", "a4", "a4",
          "golf", "golf")
make <- c("audi", "audi", "audi", "audi", "audi",
          "vw", "vw")
model_suffix <- c(
  "avant g-tron", "allroad quattro", NA, "limousine", NA,
  "gti", "gte")
buyers_gender <- c("female", NA, "female", "male", NA, "male", "female")
hp <- c(120, 140, 90, 190, 140, 140, 90)
dat <- data.frame(cars, make, model_suffix, buyers_gender, hp)
dat %>% knitr::kable()

## Let's work with literature 

<blockquote>
Little bunny Foo Foo<br>
Went hopping through the forest<br>
Scooping up the field mice<br>
And bopping them on the head
</blockquote>
---
class: middle

We’ll start by defining an object to represent little bunny Foo Foo:

```{r eval=F}
foo_foo <- little_bunny()
```

---
class: middle

And we’ll use a function for each key verb: 

`hop()`, `scoop()`, and `bop()`. 

---
class: middle


Using this object and these verbs, there are (at least) four ways we could retell the story in code:

1. Save each intermediate step as a new object.
1. Overwrite the original object many times.
1. Compose functions.
1. Use the pipe.

---
class: middle

### Option 1

The simplest approach is to save each step as a new object:

```{r eval=F}
foo_foo_1 <- hop(foo_foo, through = forest)
foo_foo_2 <- scoop(foo_foo_1, up = field_mice)
foo_foo_3 <- bop(foo_foo_2, on = head)
```

---
class: middle

### Option 2

Instead of creating intermediate objects at each step, we could overwrite the original object:

```{r eval=F}
foo_foo <- hop(foo_foo, through = forest)
foo_foo <- scoop(foo_foo, up = field_mice)
foo_foo <- bop(foo_foo, on = head)
```

---
class: middle

### Option 3

Another approach is to abandon assignment and just string the function calls together:

```{r eval=F}
bop(
  scoop(
    hop(foo_foo, through = forest),
    up = field_mice
  ), 
  on = head
)
```

--

Clearly, this option is terrible.

---
class: middle

### Option 4

Finally, we can use the pipe:

```{r eval=F}
foo_foo %>%
  hop(through = forest) %>%
  scoop(up = field_mice) %>%
  bop(on = head)
```

--

The pipe option is linear and readable. 

---
class: middle

By the way, your professors seem to also "talk" in pipes, at least those who work/teach with R. (Posted with Prof. Graham's permission.)

## What happens after the pipeline?

This bit of code (same as above) takes the object `foo_foo`, processes it through the pipeline, and the result... is printed to the console. 

```{r eval=F}
foo_foo %>%
  hop(through = forest) %>%
  scoop(up = field_mice) %>%
  bop(on = head)
```

--

After that, the object is pretty much lost. We can't do anything further with it, because we have neither written it to a variable nor saved it to a file. 

--

If we wanted to retain the result as an object, we could either (a) assign it to a new variable name or (b) *overwrite* the object we started with.

.pull-left[
### a
```{r eval=F}
my_new_variable <- foo_foo %>%
  hop(through = forest) %>%
  scoop(up = field_mice) %>%
  bop(on = head)
```
]

.pull-right[
### b
```{r eval=F}
foo_foo <- foo_foo %>%
  hop(through = forest) %>%
  scoop(up = field_mice) %>%
  bop(on = head)
```
]
